# IAM
## IAM: Identity and Access Management
- Root account created by default, shouldn;t be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Group - User : n-n relationship
  
## Permissions
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS you apply the ** least privilege principle**: don't give more permissions than a user needs
